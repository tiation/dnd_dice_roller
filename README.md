- **Fast Loading**: Data is loaded asynchronously on app startup
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to defaults if storage fails
- **Data Integrity**: JSON serialization ensures data consistency

### Storage Service Features
- Singleton pattern for efficient memory usage
- Separate storage for different data types (rolls, history, settings)
- Automatic cleanup of old roll history (keeps last 20 entries)
- Export/import functionality for data portability

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exportDate": "2025-01-17T16:30:00Z",
  "quickRolls": [...],

  "settings": {
    "selectedCategory": "all",
    "selectedDice": 20,
